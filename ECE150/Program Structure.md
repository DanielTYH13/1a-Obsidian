Def'n - General Program Structure:
- A program consists of four main parts:
	1. ==Data / Input==
		1. This is ==information that is either hardcoded into the program, or inputted by some other source, such as a sensor or API==
	2. ==The program==
		1. The program is stored in ==main memory / temporary memory==
			1. Specifically, the program is stored in the:
				1. ==Stack==
				2. ==Heap==
	3. ==Peripherals==
		1. Peripherals are ==physical devices, often intended for a human user, which allow the program to interact with the real world, and vice versa==
			1. Examples are mouses, keyboards, monitors. 
	4. The ==output==
		1. The output is abstractly a ==stream of information that is produced by the program==
			1. Examples include:
				1. Reply data from a server
				2. A stream of information from a monitoring system

- **Important note**: These definitions are fluid. For example, the input can include streams of data from perpipherals, and the output can involve outputting to a monitor. 
	- However, in my precise definition, I like to think in the purely abstract sense that input and output are ==data, and limited to that only==. 
		- If a program is outputting to a monitor, the data sent is ==the output==, and the monitor is categorized as the ==peripheral==
