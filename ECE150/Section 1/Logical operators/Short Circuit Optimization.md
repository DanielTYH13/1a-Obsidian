*Key Concepts:*
___

- Given the logical statement:
	- A AND B
		- If A is true, you must still check the truthiness of B.
		- If A is false, you can "Short Circuit" and not check B at all:
			- You know A AND B is false.
	- A OR B 
		- If A is true, you can "Short circuit" and not check b at all:
			- You know A OR B is true.

- Short-circuiting is when, regardless of the truthiness of any other arguments, the statement will evaluate to a deterministic value.
