*Key Concepts:*

- Similar to Trig functions, Hyperbolic Trig functions are the ==solutions to the unit hyperbola: $x^2-y^2 = 1$==, where coordinates are defined not in terms of $\theta$, but rather $a$, which is twice the area defined by 
	- The ray drawn from ==the origin to the point on the hyperbola that is required to satisfy $area = \frac{a}{2}$ drawn between the hyperbola, and the x axis.==

- Cosh(a) and Sinh(a) will give the respective coordinates of the point on the hyperbolasuch that a ==line drawn from the origin to that point draws an area of $\frac{a}{2}$.==

- Definitions:
	- $\cosh(a)$ = $\frac{1}{2}(e^x+e^{-x})$
		- This is an even function, as you can ==use the commutative property of addition to swap around each term after x has been negated.==
	- $sinh(a)$ $= \frac{1}{2}(e^x - e^{-x})$
		- This is an odd function, which is apparent as ==subtraction is not commutative==
