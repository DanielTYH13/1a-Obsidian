*Key Concepts:*
___

- Split the piecewise function into its cases, then solve for each case.
	- Example: To solve an ABS function, break it into the two cases, such that there is no more piecewise, then solve the individual cases.
		- You can directly do this because unlike an inequality, the condition is preserved. 
		- You are giving the restrictions to the variable by splitting it, thus giving you all possible solutions.
