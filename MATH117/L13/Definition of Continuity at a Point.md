*Key Concepts:*
___
The requirements for continuity at a point are:
- $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a}f(x) = f(a)$
- $\lim_{x \to a}f(x)$ exists
- In english, this is essentially saying that ==A function is continuous at a point $\iff$ the points directly adjacent to that point become infinitely close to exactly that point (Thus they are conjoined, and the fcn is cts)==
