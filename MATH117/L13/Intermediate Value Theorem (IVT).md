- The IVT theorem is as following:
	- Give f is cts along the closed interval $[a, b]$, then ==there is some value f(x), $x \in (a, b)$ such that f(x) = c where $c \in (f(a), f(b))$==
	- Another way of saying it is the following:
		- if f(x) is cts on $[a, b]$, and N is ==any number btwn f(a) and f(b), then there exists at least one $c\in (a, b)$ such that $f(c) = N$.==
	- The resulting interval give is open because ==it does not make sense to use the IVT on a value c such that f(c) = f(a), f(b) because you already know that it exists at x = a, b, f(x)==
- This can be very helpful proving solutions exists, as you can prove that ==Functions must pass through a certain f(x), such as f(x) = 0 - think high order polynomials that have solutions at f(x) = 0==

- Note: the IVT is a part of a family of theorems called ==Existance Theorems==. They are called this because they ==garuntee that something exists, but tell you very little about where they are located==
