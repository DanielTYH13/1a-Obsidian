*Key Concepts:*
___

The infinite discontinuity:
- This occurs when the left or right limit of the function goes to infinity. ($\frac{a}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{a}$)
	- ==Other indeterminate forms can lead to infinite discont, but typically need extra proving==

The Jump Discontinuity 
- An example is the heaviside function:
- Is simply when the ==right side of the limit does not equal the left side==

The removable discontinuity:
- Def'n: When the $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists, however it does not ==equal to f(a)==
	- This includes when $f(a)$ is undefined.
