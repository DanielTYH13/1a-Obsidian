*Key Concepts:*
___

- Recall that when inverting a fcn, the domain becomes the range and ==vice versa==.
	- NONE of the trig functions are one-to-one, thus we must ==restrict their domains such that their ranges pass the VLT==
	- Every restriction is made such that the range of the inverse function covers all possible outputs of the original function (Ex. for sin that is $[-1, 1]$)
		- For sin(x), the restriction is on ==$x\in[\frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$==
			- Inclusive as the endpoints are ==inclusively at $\frac{\pm \pi}{2}$==
		- For cos(x), the restriction is on ==$x\in[\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi]$==
			- Inclusive as the endpoints are ==inclusively at $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\pi$ 
		- For tan(x), the restriction is on ==$x\in(\frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})$==
			- Exclusive as the endpoints of the range of tan(x) are at ==$\pm$ infinity==, and tan(x) AT ==$x = \frac{\pm \pi}{2}$ is undefined==. Thus the restriction is also ==exclusive.==
				- Technically, you could restrict it inclusively,  but then it would ==just be undefined at those points.== The range for arctan using both inclusive and exclusively restricted tan will ==always be exclusive.==
