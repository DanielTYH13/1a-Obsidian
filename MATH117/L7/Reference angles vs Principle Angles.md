*Key Concepts:*
___

- The principle angle is the ==unbound angle formed between the standard position and the second arm.==
	- Note: The principle angle can exceed $2\pi$, however past this range its sinusoidal functions are equivalent to angles within the range $\theta \in [0, 2\pi]$
- The reference angle is the angle formed between ==either $\theta = 0$, $\theta = \pi$, or $\theta = 2\pi$==
	- Note that $\theta = 0, 2\pi$ are functionally ==equivalent==
	- This is defined as these arms are where the ==legs of the triangle are drawn upon==, and therefore where the sinusoidal functions are derived from. 
- When writing the solution to a trignometric equation, make sure that you add ==the variable n (considering that there are no restrictions) multiplied by the periodicity== of the equation such that you are complete in your answer.
