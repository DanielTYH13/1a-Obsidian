NOTE TO SELF. This note is here not just for memorization, but such that you can research and write the proofs for each identity later. Fill these out when you can.

*Key Concepts:*

- *When trying to prove trig identities, or solving for trig equations, try to use the known identities to remove as many different trig functions as possible in attempts to isolate one. It is always much easier to solve when there is only Cos, Sin, tan, etc.*  

this is a ==test== of the cloze feature

These are quotient identities, meaning that they are ratios between sin and cos
- tan def: ==$\tan{\theta} = \frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}}$==
- cot def:  ==$\cot{\theta} = cotangent = \frac{1}{tan{\theta}} = \frac{\cos{\theta}}{\sin{\theta}}$==

These are reciprocal functions, meaning that they are the reciprocal of sin and cos.
- csc def: ==$\csc{\theta} = \frac{1}{\sin{\theta}}$==
- sec def: ==$\sec{\theta} = \frac{1}{\cos{\theta}}$==

Pythagorean Identities
- Sum of squares of sin and cos: ==$\sin{^2\theta}+\cos{^2\theta}=1$==
- Corollary:
	- ==$1-\cos{^2\theta}=\sin{^2\theta}$==
	- ==$1-\sin{^2\theta} = \cos{^2\theta}$==

Compound Identities:
- sin additive identity: ==$\sin{(x \pm y)} = \sin{x}\cos{y} \pm \cos{x}\sin{y}$==
- cos additive identity: ==$\cos{(x\pm y)} = \cos{x}\cos{y} \mp \sin{x}\sin{y}$==
	- Note that the second sum is minus plus, meaning that the summation operators are opposite from LHS to RHS
- tan additive identity: ==$\tan{(x\pm y)} =\frac{\tan{x} \pm \tan{y}}{1 \mp \tan{x}\tan{y}}$==

Double Angle Identities
- sin: ==$\sin{2\theta} = 2\sin{\theta}\cos{\theta}$==
	- Proof: ==$\sin{(\theta + \theta)} = \sin{\theta}\cos{\theta}+\sin{\theta}\cos{\theta} = 2\sin{\theta}\cos{\theta}$==
- Cosine Double angle identities:  ==$$
\begin{align}
\cos{2\theta} & = \cos{^2\theta} - \sin{^2\theta} \\
& = 1 - 2\sin{^2\theta} \\
& = 2\cos{^2\theta} - 1
\end{align}
$$==
	- The above is particularily useful for ==removing the existance of sins or cosines==
- Tan: ==$\tan{2\theta} = \frac{2\tan{\theta}}{1-\tan{^2\theta}}$==
