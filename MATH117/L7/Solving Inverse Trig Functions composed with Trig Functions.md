- Note that $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$. 
	- However, this is always true for one-to-one functions.
	- It is not, however, true for ==restricted inverse functions== such as the trig functions.

When solving for trig functions composed of inverse trig functions, it is easier to cross out quadrants:
- You first cross out the quadrants that are out of the ==range of the inverse function.==
- Then, depending on whether the input is positive or negative, ==cross out the quadrant of the function that would result negative or positive input, respectively.==
- Take the ==RAA== of the original angle, and ==assign it in that quadrant.==
- That is your answer.

What this is essentially doing is ==Taking the angle theta and asking what angle within the restricted domain would give the same result==
- In essence, it MUST be the same reference angle for the result to be the same, but since the inverse function has a restricted range, and since trig is periodic over many quadrants, it must lie within that range.
	- A modified statement could be that for $\alpha = \mathrm{reference} \space \mathrm{angle}$, ==$f^{-1}(f(\alpha)) = \alpha$ and $f(f^{-1}(\alpha)) = \alpha$== where f(x) is a trig function. **Exer. Hint: there are two possible statements. Refer back to inverse identities.**
