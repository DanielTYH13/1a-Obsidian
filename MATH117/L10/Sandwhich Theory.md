*Key Concepts:*
___

- *Sandwhich theory gives that:*
	- Given sequences $a_n$, $b_n$, $c_n$, where $a_{n}, c_{n} \to L$
	- If $a_{n} < b_{n} < c_{n}$, then $b_{n} \to L$
		- This requirements are that the above inequality can be true after some terms, but then must be true forever.

	- This is quite useful for sequences such as $a_{n} = \frac{\sin{n}}{n}$
		- You cannot evaluate this using typical limit laws and tools, as $\displaystyle \lim_{x->\infty}\sin{x} = DNE$
			- It is oscillating. 
	- *Indicators for sdw thm* (Not necessarily necessitates)
		- If there are any periodic functions in the numerator
		- Ex. 
			- sin(x)
			- cos(x)
			- (-1)^n
