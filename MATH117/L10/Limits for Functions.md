*Key Concepts:*
___
- Some definitions of function limits:
	- ==$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} e^n = \infty$==
	- ==$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} \ln{n} = \infty$==
	- ==$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} \arctan{n} = \frac{\pi}{2}$==
	- ==$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} \sinh{n} = \infty$==
	- ==$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} \cosh{n} = \infty$==
	- ==$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to \infty} \tanh{n} = n$==
	- For $|r| > 1$, then $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to -\infty}r^x = 0$
		- This is because ==As x gets smaller the "radicand" of r gets larger and larger, and thus the limit is 0.
	- For $r > 0$ and where $x^r$ is defined,
		- $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to \infty}\frac{1}{x^r} = 0$
		- $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to -\infty}\frac{1}{x^r} = 0$
		- This is true because as the base gets larger, so will the exponent.
			- Also, it does not matter the sign -it will still approach 0.
	- $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{\sin{x}}{x} = 1$
		- A proper proof for this can be found yourself.
The following function limits DNE for $\displaystyle \lim_{n\to \infty}$
- all ==primary trignometric functions==
- ==$(-1)^n$==
- Any ==periodic function== <!--SR:!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2025-10-20,1,230!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250-->

- *Many of the concepts from limits of sequences are easily extended to functions*

Defn': The limit of a function at a point: 
- Notated as $\displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}$ 
	- Note -> X here can be a real. This is contrasting to sequences, where n was a natural. 

Defn': One sided limits:
- Notated as $\displaystyle \lim_{x->a^{\pm}}$
- This represents the limit of a function at point a as it approaches from the left (-) or the right (+) side.

**Important**: Limits only care about what is happening NEAR x = a, not AT x = a
- This is why when we have indeterminate behavior, we can manipulate the function to have some form that we can look at the behavior near the point 
	- If the behavior is indeterminate, that could mean that ==it is undefined AT the point.== However, we can work around this because ==we only care what is happening at the point.==
