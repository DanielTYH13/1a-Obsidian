*Key Concepts:*
___
- Radians:
	- Take the two lines that define an angle
	- Draw a unit circle centered around the angle's vertex
	- Find the arc length spanned from one intersection between the lines to another
	- Divide this ==arc length by the radius of the circle, in this case 1==
	- The resulting angle is the radian measure
- In essence, the radian measure of an angle is the $\frac{s}{r}$ where r is the radius of a circle that is centered around the vertex and s is the arc length spanned by this. 
- When dividing the entirety of the circle by its radius, you get ==$2\pi$. you can then multiply $2\pi$ by certain fractions to achieve right triangles, acute triangles, etc.==a
	- Acute: $\theta < \frac{\pi}{2}$
	- Right: $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$
	- Obtuse: $\theta > \frac{\pi}{2}$
	- Note: The angle $\theta$ must be the reference angle, and not reflex angle. 

The trignometric functions:
- ![[Pasted image 20250920184729.png]]
	- Domain: ==$D: x\in(-\infty, \infty)$==
	- Range: ==$R: y\in[-1, 1]$==
	- ==$0, \theta=2\pi n$== **Exer: When is sin(x) 0?**
	- ==$1, \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}+2\pi n$== **Exer: When is sin(x) 1?**
	- ==$-1, \theta = \frac{-\pi}{2}+2\pi n$== **Exer: When is sin(x) -1?**
- ![[Pasted image 20250920184738.png]]
	- Domain: ==$D: x\in(-\infty, \infty)$==
	- Range: ==$R: y\in[-1, 1]$==
	- ==$0, \theta = \pi + 2\pi n$== **Exer: When is cos(x) 0?**
	- ==$1, \theta = 0+2\pi n$== **Exer: When is cos(x) 1?**
	- ==$-1, \theta = \pi+2\pi n$== **Exer: When is cos(x) -1?**
	- **Cosine is the sine function phase shifted ==$\frac{-\pi}{2}$==
- ![[Pasted image 20250920184640.png]]
	- Domain: ==$D: x\in(-\infty, \infty) \backslash \{\frac{\pi}{2} + \pi n\}$==
	- Range: ==$R: y\in(-\infty, \infty)$==
	- ==$0, \theta = 0+\pi$== **Exer: When is tan(x) equal to 0?**
	-  Tan is ==**pi== periodic**, meaning it repeats itself over a period of $\pi$

- Exercise: The two special triangles are those with==.==
	1.  Legs 1, Hypotenuse $\sqrt{2}$
	2. $leg_{1}= 1$, $hypotenuse = 2$, $leg_{2} = \sqrt{3}$
	Using the above special triangles, find the special angles.
