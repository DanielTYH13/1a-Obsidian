*Key Concepts:*
___
- Radians:
	- Take the two lines that define an angle
	- Draw a unit circle centered around the angle's vertex
	- Find the arc length spanned from one intersection between the lines to another
	- Divide this arc length by the radius of the circle, in this case 1
	- The resulting angle is the radian measure
- In essence, the radian measure of an angle is the $\frac{s}{r}$ where r is the radius of a circle that is centered around the vertex and s is the arc length spanned by this. 
- When dividing the entirety of the circle by its radius, you get $2\pi$. you can then multiply $2\pi$ by certain fractions to achieve right triangles, acute triangles, etc. 

The trignometric functions:

	- $D: x\in(-\infty, \infty)$
	- $R: y\in[-1, 1]$
	- $0, \theta=2\pi n$
	- $1, \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}+2\pi n$
	- $-1, \theta = \frac{-\pi}{2}+2\pi n$

	- $D: x\in(-\infty, \infty)$
	- $R: y\in[-1, 1]$
	- $0, \theta = \pi + 2\pi n$
	- $1, \theta = 0+2\pi n$
	- $-1, \theta = \pi+2\pi n$
	- **Cosine is the sine function phase shifted $\frac{-\pi}{2}$**
- ![[Pasted image 20250920184640.png]]
	- $D: x\in(-\infty, \infty) \backslash \{\frac{\pi}{2} + \pi n\}$
	- $R: y\in(-\infty, \infty)$
	- $0, \theta = 0+\pi$
	-  Tan is **pi periodic**, meaning it repeats itself over a period of $\pi$

- Exercise: The two special triangles are those with 
	1.  Legs 1, Hypotenuse $\sqrt{2}$
	2. $leg_{1}= 1$, $hypotenuse = 2$, $leg_{2} = \sqrt{3}$
	Using the above special triangles, find the special angles.
