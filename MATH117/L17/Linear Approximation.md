- Def'n. Assume that the function f(x) is differentiable at x = a. Then,
	- The linear approximation of f(x) at x = a is $a(x) = f'(a)(x-a)+f(a)$
		- This is quite literally just the tangent line of the thing. 

- What are linear approximations used for? 
	- They are handy when you want to turn a complex function into a smaller function that encapsulates generally the behavior at values very close to a.

- Linear approximations of changes:
	- Given $\Delta x$ is very small, then:
		- $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \approx \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}y}$
	- Thus, we can aproximate very small changes in y:
		- $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \approx \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}y}$
		- $\Delta y \approx \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}y}\Delta x$
	- Remember: The $\mathrm{d}$ in $\mathrm{d}x$ and $\mathrm{d}y$ represents an "infinitesimally small change of" Thus,
		- $\mathrm{d}y \approx \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}y} \mathrm{d}x$
		- $\mathrm{d}y \approx f'(x)\mathrm{d}x$
			- Note, these are still approximations.
			- Note, the dx term is called the independant differential, and the dy term is called the dependant differential.
