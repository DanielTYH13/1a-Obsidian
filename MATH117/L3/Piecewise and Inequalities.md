- When working with Piecewise inequalities, split the work into cases where the domain of certain values of x correspond to different resolutions of the piecewise function. 
	1.  An easy way to do this is by using a number line. 
	2. Then resolve the piecewise equation depending on the domain, and solve normally. Ensure that the domain corresponds with the ranges specified in the piecewise function
	3. Once you have finished solving the inequality, find the intersection between the inequality and the domain
		1. This is because both of the following are true for the inequality to be valid
			1. The inequality at that domain is the inequality that you are solving for
			2. The inequality has a range at that domain.
		2. There are restrictions applied by the original piecewise inequality
	4. Finally, union all of the intersections to find your final answer.

- Heaviside functions:
	- Heaviside functions are defined as the piecewise function: $H(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, x<0\\ 1, 0\le x\end{array}\right.$
		- Using this definition of the heaviside function, it is possible to condense piecewise functions into one-line functions using transformations:
			- $f(x)H(t-k)$: "Enable" f at the point x = k
			- $f(x)(1-H(t-k))$: "Disable" f at the point x = k
