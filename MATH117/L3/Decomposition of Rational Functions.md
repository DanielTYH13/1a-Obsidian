*Key Concepts:*
___
- Solving Process:
	1. If the function is not in proper form, you must first long divide
		1. This is because you cannot merge two rational functions of the form $\frac{Ax+b}{(x+a)^2}$ into a function of greater power in the numerator than denominator
	2. Otherwise, factor the function completely
	3. Then, equate depending on the form of the function
	4. Match coefficients and solve for them.

- Decomposition of a function is the reverse of adding two rational functions
	- Instead of finding an LCM to add both rationals, you dvide into the individual components of the LCM and split the numerators instead
- Requirements of Decomposition:
	- The numerator function must have a lower degree than the denominator function
	- Else, use long division to reduce to quotients and remainders. 

Three Forms of Decomposition:
- Distinct Linear
	- Denom: $(x+a)(x+b)...$
	- General decomposed form: $\frac{A}{x+a}+\frac{B}{x+b}...$
- Repeated Linear
	- Denom: $(x+k)^n$
	- General decomposed form: $\frac{A}{x+k}+\frac{D}{(x+k)^2}+\frac{C}{(x+k)^3}\dots$
- Distinct irreducible quadratic
	- Denom: $(ax^{2}+bx+c)\cdot(dx^{2}+ex+c)\dots$
	- General decomposed form: $\frac{Ax+b}{ax^{2}+bx+c}+\frac{Cx+d}{dx^{2}+ex+c}\cdots$
- Repeated irreducible quadratic 
	- Denom: $(ax^{2}+bx+c)^n$
	- General decomposed form: $\frac{Ax+b}{ax^{2}+bx+c}+\frac{Cx+d}{(ax^{2}+bx+c)^2}\dots$
