- Def'n: The Derivative Fcn:
	- The Derivative function is the definition of a derivative at a point, except ==generalized to an arbitrary point x==
	- We use the following definition of a derivative as it leaves us with only one variable:
		- $\frac{d}{dx} = \displaystyle \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$
	- However, in order to generalize it, we simply swap out $a$ for $x$.
