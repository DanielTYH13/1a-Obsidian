*Key Concepts:*
___

Memorize! But also prove when you have to chance==:==

- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(k) = 0, k \in \mathbb{R}$==: The derivative of a constant is ==0.== 
	- The slope is 0 OR the constant doesn't change in respect to x.
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(x^n) =nx^{n-1}, n \in \mathbb{R}$==: The derivative of a polynomial is ==the base times the exponent to the exponent minus one==
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(kf(x)) = k \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}f(x)$==: A constant coefficient of a function can ==be extracted from the function.==
	- Intuitively, this is because the constant stays the same I.R.T x, but always "multiplies" the rate of change of f(x). Thus it can be drawn out. 
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x} (f(x)\pm g(x)) = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}f(x)\pm \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}g(x)$==: The Derivative of the sum of two functions is ==the sum of individual derivatives of each function==
	- Intuitively, adding the individual rates of change does not affect each one individual, but they do sum with each other to affect the total ROC.
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}e^x = e^x$==: The definition of $e^x$ is ==that its derivative is itself. ==
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(a^x) = a^x \ln(a)$==: The derivative of an exponential function is ==the function times the ln of the base.==
	- Idk how to prove this lmao
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(\ln(x)) = \frac{1}{x}$==: The derivative of the natural log function is ==the inverse of the argument. == 
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(\log_{a}(x)) = \frac{1}{x\ln(a)}=$==: The derivative of the log function is ==the inverse of the product of the argument and the natural log of the base. ==
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(\sin(x)) = \cos(x)$==: The derivative of sine is ==cosine==
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(\cos(x)) = -\sin(x)$==: The derivative of cosine is ==negative sine==
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(\tan(x)) = \sec^2(x)$==: The derivative of tan is ==secant squared.==
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(\sinh(x)) = \cosh(x)$==: The derivative of sinh is ==cosh==
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(\cosh(x)) = \sinh(x)$==: The derivative of cosh is ==sinh. (Not negative)==
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(\tanh(x)) = \mathrm{sech}^2(x)$==: The derivative of tanh is ==sech squared.==
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(f(x)\cdot g(x)) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)$==: The derivate of f times g is ==the sum of the derivative of times g and the derivative of g times f.==
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}) = \frac{f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}$== The derivative of the quotient of f and g is ==the difference between the derivative of f times g and the derivative of g times f all over the square of g.==
- ==$\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x)$==: The derivative of f composed with g is ==the individual derivative of f composed with g times the individual derivative of g.==
