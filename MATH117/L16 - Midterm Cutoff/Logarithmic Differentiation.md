- General Process of Logarithmic Differentiation:
	1. Take the $\ln$ of both sides.
	2. Use ==log laws== to simplify the equation - Remember to ==strategize at first! see what is annoying, and what forms you might want to change to.==
	3. Take the ==derivative of both sides==
	4. Isolate for the ==derivative of y==
	5. Substitute the definition of ==y in respect to x back into the equation.== <!--SR:!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2025-10-20,1,230!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250-->
