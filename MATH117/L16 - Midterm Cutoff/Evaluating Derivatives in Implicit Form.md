*Key Concepts:*
___
- A key concept that must be understood:
	- When differentiating y = f(x), you are really just differentiating both ==sides.==
		- In other words, it is correct to be able to apply differentiation to both sides, as you are saying that y is EQUAL TO f(x).
	- The reason this is important is that when differentiating $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{dx}}y$, for example, you get $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{dx}}$. However, this does not actually mean anything - it is simply like a placeholder for another function.
		- All it is saying is that this term represents the ==algebraic relationship of how y changes in respect to x==
			- It represents a tangible thing, a real ==term==, however it isn't explicitly stated what that term is.
	- However, when you differentiate explicitly, this isn't immediately clear, as you necessarily also differentiate the exact ==relation of y to x==, or in other words, the terms that aren't ==y==, so you don't need to ==do any rearranging.== <!--SR:!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2025-10-22,3,250-->

- Note: The reason why you can't just use normal differentiation rules on an implicitly stated function is ==because you will be differentiating a variable (Say A) in respect to a different variable (Say B).==
	- And since the function is ==implicitly stated, you don't know what A is in respect to B, so you cannot evaluate it.==

- Implicit Differentiation with Y and X:
	- When differentiating an implicit function, you also ==Take the derivative of both sides==.
		- You are saying that since both sides are ==equal==, they will change in ==respect to x the same way==
		- These two sides by themselves are COMPLETELY different to ==how y changes in respect to x==.
			- However, since y is ==within one or both of the sides==, the change of the sides ==involves== how ==y changes in respect to x==
				- In other words, the ==term== $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{dx}}$ is a part of each side.
	- You then isolate for the $\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{dx}}$ term to get its definition. <!--SR:!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2025-10-22,3,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250!2000-01-01,1,250-->

- Note - what if you have multiple different variables outside of x? Doesn't this become impossible, unless you have another unique equation?
