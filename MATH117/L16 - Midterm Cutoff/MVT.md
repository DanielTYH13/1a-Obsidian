*Key Concepts:*
___

- Thm: Mean Value Theorem (MVT),
	- Assumptions: Given the function $f$, suppose $f$ is continuous on the closed domain $[a, b]$, and differentiable on the open domain $(a, b)$
	- Assuming the necessary assumptions: 
		- $\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{dx}}f(c) = \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$, $c\in \{(a, b) | \mathbb{R}\}$ 
		- "The instantaneous rate of change of f at some point c in the open domain (a,b) will be equivalent to the mean rate of change of f over a, b"

- Note: MVT is an existance theorem.
