*Key Concepts:*
___

- Thm: Let $f(x)$ be double-differentiable on the interval I:
	- If $f''(x) > 0$ on I, then f(x) is "concave up" on I.
		- The derivative/slope, $f'(x)$, is increasing over I.
			- This is true regardless of if the slope itself is -ve or +ve

				- -ve: ![[Pasted image 20251030152603.png|153]]
	- If $f''(x) < 0$ on I, then f(x) is "concave down" on I.
		- The derivative/slope, $f'(x)$, is decreasing over I.
			- This is true regardless of if the slope itself is -ve or +ve
				- +ve: ![[Pasted image 20251030152531.png|163]]
				- -ve: ![[Pasted image 20251030152515.png|153]]

- Points of inflection:
	- POI can occur either at:
		- $f''(x) = 0$
			- $f''(x)$ passes through the x axis.
		- $f''(x)$ is not defined.
			- $f''(x)$ goes from inf to -inf.
	- Since $f''(x)$ does not necessarily need to pass through the x axis at these points, they are only candidates. We need to manually check them.
