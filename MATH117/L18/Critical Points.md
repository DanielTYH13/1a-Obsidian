*Key Concepts:*
___

- A critical point is where $f'(x) = 0$ or is undefined
	- These are candidates for local extrema as in order for a max or min to occur, $f'(x)$ must either pass through 0 or from $\pm \infty$ to $\mp \infty$ (In the process of changing sign.) 
	- Note: You must test crit.p for extrema as $f'(x)$ does not necessarily have to change sign at $f'(x) = 0, undef$.
