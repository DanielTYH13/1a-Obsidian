*Key Concepts:*
___

- Closed Interval Method for finding Global Extrema *on a closed interval*:
	- *To find global extrema on closed interval $[a,b]$, ie. local extrema*
		- Evaluate $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.
		- Find crit.p on $[a, b]$ and evaluate there. 
			- No need to check if it is an extrema, as if it isn't, some other value will be higher
			- This is similar in spirit to existence theorems.
		- Take highest and lowest values.
