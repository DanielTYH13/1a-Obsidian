Quite conveniently, a concise algebraic definition of continuity at a point is given by: ==$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to x_0}(f(x)-f(x_0)=0)$==, where $x_0$ is the point we are evaluating.
- This is true because if the above equation is true, then the following must be true:
	- ==$f(x_0)$ exists.==
	- ==The $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to x_{0}}f(x)$ exists==
	- ==$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to x_{0}-}f(x) = \lim_{x \to x_{0}+}f(x)$, since The $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to x_{0}}f(x)$ exists==
	- ==$\displaystyle \lim_{x \to x_{0}}f(x) = f(x_{0})$, since its difference is 0==
- Since the above conditions match exactly with the conditions for continuity at a point, if the given statement is true, then the function is continuous at point $x_{0}$
