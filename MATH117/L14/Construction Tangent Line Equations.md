*Key Concepts:*
___
- Def'n - Point-Slope form: 
	- Point slope form can be used to construct a line given the following information.
		- A point that lies on the line
		- The slope of the line
	- It is derived from the equation of the slope: 
		- $m = \frac{y_{2}- y_{1}}{x_{2}- x_{1}}$
		- $y_{2}-y_{1}=m(x_{2}-x_{1})$
		- $y_{2}= m(x_{2}-x_{1})+y_{1}$
		- $y = m(x - x_{1})+ y_{1}$
			- Given that $(x_{1},y_{1})$ is the given point, and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$ is the unknown point - generalized to $(x, y)$.

- Def'n - Finding eqn for tangent line at point on line:
	- It is given by ==$y = \frac{d}{dx}f(a)(x - a) + f(a)$==, where the derivative is at $(a, f(a))$.
