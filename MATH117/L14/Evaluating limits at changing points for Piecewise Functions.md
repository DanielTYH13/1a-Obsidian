*Key Concepts:*

When you are evaluating a limit for a piecewise function at point $x = a$, and the piecewise function transitions from one behaviour to another at that point, then you must ==Split the function into two right side and left side limits==
- This is because you are not garunteed that ==there will be the same behaviour on both sides==
	- In other words, you want to evaluate for the limit for both behaviours, and ==if they match, great! Take one of the values==
	- Otherwise, they do not match and the ==comprehensive limit at x=a DNE.==
- You have to do this with any function that isn't ==garunteed to be continuous at x = a or if the discontinuity at x = a *might* not be removable.==
