- The Extreme Value Theorem (EVT) states simply that, given f(x):
	- Def'n ==Given f(x) is cts on the *closed* interval $x \in [a, b]$, then there is an absolute max and min on the open interval.
	- When doesn't it work? ==EVT does not apply on open intervals== or when ==The func is not continuous==
		- One main case for continuity:
			- If there is a jump discont, or just a point discont, you can get ==infinitely closer to that point, but never at that point, therefore it is not a max or a min==
				- This doesn't mean that a function with a discont cannot ==have both a max and a min, it just means that it is not garunteed.==
		- Two main cases for open intervals:
			- Case 1: The interval is open at b, and the limit of f(x) as x tends to b *seems to be the max*
				- However, ==this is not a max as you can infinitely closer to b, but never at b. In essence, no matter how close you get, you can always get closer, which will result in a higher value==
					- Therefore there is no abs max.
				- The same applies to if the limit looks to be an abs min.
			- Case 2: The interval is open towards infinity:
				- In this case, it is trivial that ==If the function diverges, there will be no abs max or min==
				- However, this doesn't mean that there isn't an absolute max or min. 
					- For example, take that there is a local min on the range $[a, b]$, then you must prove that the ==function converges to a value above that local min at positive infinity==
						- if you are able to do this, then you can say that there is an ==abs min (and corrolary a max) on the interval which is open towards infinity.==
					- This, however, does not discredit the EVT, as it does not tell you which functions have abs max min for EVERY FUNCTION:
						- It ==only GARUNTEES the existence of the max / min for the functions that fit its conditions==
