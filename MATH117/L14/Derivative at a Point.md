Def'n - The average rate of change (AROC): The AROC is ==an average of how fast the function increases or decreases (In other words, how the f(x) value changes) over a given interval:==
- The AROC in the interval $a, b$ is given by $\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$

Def'n - The derivative at a point: The derivative at a point is the ==limit of the AROC as the b approaches a==
- In other words, it is the ==instantaneous rate of change at a point - the slope of the point at that point and that point only.==
	- Goemetrically, it is the ==tangent line of the function at that point==
	- Its very silly and kind of absurd - but thats okay :D. You understand it.
- There are two algebraic definitions of a derivative at a point - both are identical, but are convenient for their own purposes. NOTE: Memorize these limit definitions like the back of your hand, because they are very useful for understanding the existence of derivatives at a point or range==.==
	1. $\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \displaystyle \lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(a)-f(x)}{a-x}$
		1. This form of the derivative at a point is useful for ==evaluating the derivative at a single point and a single point only==
			1. This is because it is easy to just plug in the values.
	2. $\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = \displaystyle \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(a + h)-f(a)}{h}$
		1. This form of the derivative at a point is useful for ==creating generalized functions to evaluate the derivative at any point by using "x" for the a value instead of a constant==
			1. This is because this function allows for only one variable to be in the limit.
- NOTE: A derivative, whether at a point or the derivative function, is ==strictly the result of a limit==, as shown ==above==
	- When you use the derivative ==rules, it is easy to forget that they are just generalized shortcuts for obtaining the derivative from first principles== 
		- In reality, you are actually ==applying the limit definition of the derivative and solving==
	- THIS MEANS THAT:
		- If the limit ==exists==, we say f is ==differentiable at x=a==
		- If the limit ==DNE==, we say f is ==not differentiable at x=a==
