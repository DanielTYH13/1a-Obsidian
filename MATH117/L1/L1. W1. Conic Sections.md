*Key Concepts:*
___

- The generalized conic section is defined as ==$Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$==
	- ![[fzszgf7gquwjpzlbdzja1.jpg]]
- Ellipses are defined as ==$\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}=1$==, where ==$(h, k)$== is the center of the ellipse, ==$a$== is the horizontal width of the ellipse, and ==$b$== is the vertical width of the ellipse. 
	- #TODO: Create an intuitive explanation for this / a proof, instead of just memorizing the above.
	- In the most simplified case, an ellipse can be conceptualized as the ==square root of a parabola that opens down. Since a square root has both positive and negative solutions, the parabola becomes a closed loop.==
- To determine the form of a Conic Section (CS)
	- If ==$B^2 - 4AC < 0$==, it is either circle or ellipse.
		- If $A = C$, it is a circle
		- Elsewise, it is an ellipse. (Height and width)
	- If $B^2 - 4AC = 0$, the CS is a parabola
	- If $B^2-4AC > 0$ The CS is a hyperbola
- The proof of using the determinant to evaluate the form of the CS:
	- ![[Pasted image 20251019134454.png|500]]
	- This equation looks like this: 
		- Aw hell nah I have no clue why this is true :( 
		- #TODO Ill have to ask my prof
	- Just know that the sign of the ==quadratic y term== determines the form of the conic section, and that that is determined by ==$B^2 - 4AC$.
