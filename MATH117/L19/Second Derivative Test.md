*Key Concepts:*
___

- Given that there is a crit.p for f(x) at x = c, and $f'(c)$ exists (Ie. $f'(c) = 0$)
	- If $f''(c) > 0$, then there is a minimum at x = c
	- If $f''(c) < 0$, then there is a maximum at x = c.
	- If $f''(c) = 0, \mathrm{undefined}$, there are many possibilities and we must use [[First Derivative Test|FDT]]
