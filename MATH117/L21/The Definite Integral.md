- One way to calculate the definite integral is to use the [[Riemann Sums and Finding the Area Under a Curve|Riemann Sum]]. However, writing this notation every time we want to find an integral is very cumbersome. 
	- Instead, we use the following notation: $\int^b_{a}f(x)dx$
		- The $\int$ is just a fancy s, which stands for sum (Specifically, an infinite sum)
			- The sum in question are the terms $f(x)\mathrm{d}x$, which correlate to "infinitely small rectangles" (Remember that the dx is an infinitesimally small change)
		- The a and b are the bounds.
	- In full english, this notation says: "Take the infinite sum of infinitesimally small rectangles that compose the curve in the range $[a, b]$".
