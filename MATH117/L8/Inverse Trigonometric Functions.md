*Key Concepts:*
___

- You must restrict the domain of the trig functions as they are not one-to-one
	- One-to-one means that every x value has a unique y value, and that every y value has a unique x value. In other words, mirrored over y = x, the function will pass the VLT
- In order to create an inverse trig function that covers all possible ranges of the original function, you need to restrict it in the area such that it covers both positive and negative values. This is as follows for the primary trig functions:
	- Cosine: $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ -> $(-1, 1)$
	- Sin: $[0, \pi]$ -> $(-1, 1)$ 
	- Tan: $[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$ -> $(-\infty, \infty)$

- While all of the above functions span a domain of $\pi$, both cos and sin are $2\pi$ periodic while tan is $\pi$ periodic.

- Finding the quadrant of an angle that is *defined* by an inverse trig function (See common mistakes):
	- Determine the range of the inverse function 
	- Determine the sign of the input
	- Depending on the CAST rule, eliminate remaining quadrants
- *Keep in mind, this does not tell you the exact angle, it is only a method to use to tell which quadrant the angle with the given trig ratio must be in*

*Common Mistakes:*
___

- CORE MISTAKE - if you are *defining* an angle using the inverse function, then it follows the rule that it must be within the defined range. *However*, if you are solving for an angle using its trig ratio, since there was no initial restriction, you must consider the quadrants where the sign of the angle also gives the respective trig ratio. *For example*, with $x \in [-1, 1]$:
	- $\theta = arccos(x)$, - You can apply the rules to find the *Exact* quadrant of theta
	- This does not hold true when you do this: $sin^-1(sin(x))$ as it discards quadrant info. 
		- $cos(\theta) = x$
		- $arccos(x) \ne \theta$
	- Since for the sign of theta, arccos only considers two quadrants to prevent failing the VLT.
