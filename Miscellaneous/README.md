Constantly review each note and the flashcards as they are scheduled.
Whenever you are given a flashcard, you are required to actually explain the answer in your own words. Same thing goes for when reviewing an entire note. 
If you have forgotten a subject, Navigate to it and use the spaced repetition (Repeat it if you've completely forgotten it, just use what notes you are supposed to review otherwise)
Then find a source (Ideally a textbook) for many application problems, and simply solve as many as suitable.
