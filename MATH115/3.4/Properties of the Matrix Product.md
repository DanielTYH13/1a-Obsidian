#TODO prove the following properties, and document them. 

- Let $c\in \mathbb{R}$, and A, B, C be matrices of appropriate sizes. Then:
	1. ==$IA = A$ $\implies$== I is an identity matrix.
	2. ==$AI = A$ $\implies$== I is an identity matrix.
	3. ==$A(BC) = (AB)C \implies$== matrix multiplication is associative. 
	4. $A(B+C) = AB + AC \implies$== Left Distributive Law
	5. ==$(B + C)A = BA + CA \implies$== Right distributive law.
	6. ==$(cA)B = c(AB) = A(cB) \implies$== Matrix Multiplication is associative with Scalar Multiplication. 
	7. ==$(AB)^T = A^TB^T \implies$== Transpose is distributable over matrix multiplication.
