*Key Concepts:*
___

- If U is a k-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$, then:
	- A set of vectors more than k in U is linearly dependent. 
		- #TODO I dont get this, ask the prof.
	- A set of fewer than k vectors in U cannot span U.
	- A set of exactly k vectors in U spans U if and only if it is linearly independant.

#TODO Fully understand and make a note on the last algorithm (Carrying a basis set of subspace U of Rn to a basis of Rn)
