*Key Concepts:*
___

- Let $B = \{\vec{v_{1}}, \ldots, \vec{v_{k}} \}$ be a basis for the subspace $U$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. If the set $C = \{\vec{j_{1}}, \ldots , \vec{j_{i}}\}$ is a set in U and i > k, then C is linearly dependant.
	- This stems from [[Theorem 4.5.6]]: Which states that there can only be n linearly independant vectors in subspace $U$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$. 
		- In other words, no matter where you put another vector, it can always be represented by a linear combination of the others
			- If the first n vectors are linearly dependant, then the set with a new vector will still be linearly dependant.
			- If the first n vectors are linearly independant, then that set is a basis for U, which means that any new vector in subspace U must be able to be represented as a linear combination of the first three.
