*Key Concepts:*
___

- Let U be a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and let $B$ be a finite subset of $U$. Then $B$ is a basis of U if:
	- B is linearly independent and
	- $U = \mathrm{Span}(B)$

- Note: The basis set B of subspace U can be thought of in two ways:
	- A minimal spanning set of U, such that if you remove any element of B, then B will no longer span U. This is because B is linearly independant. See [[Linear Dependence and Independence|the dependency theorem and reduction theorem]]
	- A maximal spanning set of U, such that if you add any element of U to B, then B will become linearly dependant. This is because since the span of U is B, any new vector that isn't already in B will be a linear combination of B by [[Linear Dependence and Independence|Dependency Theorem]].

- Note: Given any arbitrary subspace of U, we are able to construct a linearly independent spanning set of U by carrying it to REF form. Thus, every arbitrary subspace U has a basis! 

- Note: The basis of a subspace, while not the subspace itself, gives you a general idea of what the subspace's properties are.
	- The dimension of each vector in the basis is the dimensionality of the superspace
	- The number of vectors in the basis is the dimensionality of the subspace.
		- This is because n vectors can only describe an n dimensional space, and the basis is Linearly Independant, meaning dim(subspace) = # vectors in basis exactly.
