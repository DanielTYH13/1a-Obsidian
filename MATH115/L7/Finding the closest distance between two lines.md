*Key Concepts:*
___
- Let $\vec{x_{1}}, \vec{x_{2}} \in \mathbb{R}^3$ be lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$, defined using vector equations
- Define a plane using a point from one of the lines, and both lines as the direction vectors.
	- This will define a plane that is parallel to the second line and has infinite solutions to the first. 
	- It is garunteed that for two given lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$, there exists a plane that is parallel to both lines. 
- Take any arbitrary point on the plane and any arbitrary point on $\vec{x_{2}}$, and take its projection with the normal of the plane (Found using the cross product)
- **This is the closest distance between two lines.**
