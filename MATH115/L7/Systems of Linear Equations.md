Definition: A linear equation:
- $a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\ldots +a_{n}x_{n} = b$ 
	- Where $a_n$ are coefficients, $x_n$ are variables, and $b$ is ==constant==

Definition: A system of Linear Equations:
- ==Some amount of linear equations, where every repeat of a variable corresponds to the same one from before==

A linear system of equations looks like this:

- Let $c\in \mathbb{R}$, and A, B, C be matrices of appropriate sizes. Then:
	1. ==$IA = A$ $\implies$== I is an identity matrix.
	2. ==$AI = A$ $\implies$== I is an identity matrix. Note: ==Identity matrix multiplication is commutative==
	3. ==$A(BC) = (AB)C \implies$== matrix multiplication is associative.
	4. $A(B+C) = AB + AC \implies$== Left Distributive Law
	5. ==$(B + C)A = BA + CA \implies$== Right distributive law.
	6. ==$(cA)B = c(AB) = A(cB) \implies$== Matrix Multiplication is associative with Scalar Multiplication.
	7. ==$(AB)^T = A^TB^T \implies$== Transpose is distributable over matrix multiplication. <!--SR:!2025-10-24,3,250-->

The possible number of solutions for any given linear system of equations:
	- 0
	- 1
	- $\infty$
- This means that for any given linear system, if you can find two valid solutions, you immediately know that ==there are infinitely many solutions==
