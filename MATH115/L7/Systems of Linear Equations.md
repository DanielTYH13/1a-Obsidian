Definition: A linear equation:
- $a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\ldots +a_{n}x_{n} = b$ 
	- Where $a_n$ are coefficients, $x_n$ are variables, and $b$ is ==constant==

Definition: A system of Linear Equations:
- ==Some amount of linear equations, where every repeat of a variable corresponds to the same one from before==

A linear system of equations looks like this:

A homogenous linear system of equations is one where ==all constant values are 0:==

The possible number of solutions for any given linear system of equations:
	- 0
	- 1
	- $\infty$
- This means that for any given linear system, if you can find two valid solutions, you immediately know that ==there are infinitely many solutions==
