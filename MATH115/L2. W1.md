*Key Concepts:*
___
- Linear combinations - linear combinations are a single vector expressed as the scalar multiple of one or more other vectors. 
	- Any vector in R^n can be expressed as a linear combination of another vector given that
		- There a n vectors
		- All vectors are non zero
		- All vectors are not scalar multiples of any other.

*Significant Theorems:*

- Fundamental Properties of Linear Algebra:  Let $\vec{w}, \vec{x}, \vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, and $c, d \in \mathbb{R}$
	- V1: $\vec{x} + \vec{y}  \in \mathbb{R}^n$: Vector addition is restricted to the Reals. Meaning, no matter what two real vectors you add to each other, it will never leave the set of R^n  
	- V2: $\vec{x} + \vec{y} = \vec{y} + \vec{y}$: Vector addition is commutative. Geometrically, this is proven by showing that a parallelogram, regardless of which leg you traverse, will lead you to the same point.  ![[Pasted image 20250916183048.png]]
		- Algebraically, this is proven by the following $$\begin{split}\vec{x} + \vec{y} & = \begin{bmatrix}x_{1} + y_1 \\ \vdots\\ x_{n} + y_{n} \end{bmatrix} \\ \vec{x} + \vec{y} & = \begin{bmatrix} y_{1} + x_{1} \\ \vdots \\ y_{n}+ x_{n}\end{bmatrix} \\ & = \vec{y} + \vec{x} \end{split}$$
		- This is derived through scalar commutivity for each individual component.
	- V3: Vector addition is associative: $\vec{x} + (\vec{y} + \vec{w}) = (\vec{x} + \vec{y}) + \vec{w}$. Regardless of the order you put any given n vectors, they will all point to the same place. 
		- This follows a similar proof to vector commutivity, but instead employs the associative property of vectors:  $$
\begin{split} 
\vec{x} + (\vec{y} + \vec{w}) & = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_{1} + (y_{1}+w_{1}) \\ \vdots \\ x_{n}+(y_{n}+w_{n})) \end{bmatrix} \\ 
& = 
\begin{bmatrix} (x_{1} + y_{1})+w_{1} \\ \vdots \\ (x_{n}+y_{n})+w_{n}) \end{bmatrix} \\ 
& = (\vec{x} + \vec{y}) + \vec{w})
\end{split} \\ 
$$
	- V4: Scalar Multiplication in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is closed. Meaning that if you multiply two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, it will never leave this set.
	- V5: $c(d\vec{x}) = (cd)\vec{x}$. This can be proven by expanding into components, and then using the associative property on the scalar multiples, and the component. 
	- V6: $(c+d)\vec{x} = c\vec{x} + d\vec{x}$. This can be proved, again, by expanding into components, and then using the scalar distributive property to achieve the RHS.
	- V7: $c(\vec{x} + \vec{y}) = c\vec{x} + c\vec{y}$. This can be proved, again, by expanding into components, where $c(x_{n}+y_{n)}=cx_{n}+cy_{n}$.
