*Key Concepts:*
___

- Thm: Reduction Thm:
	- Let $S = \{\vec{v}_{1}, \vec{v}_{2}, \ldots, \vec{v}_{k}\}, \vec{v}_{i}\in S$
	- $\vec{v}_{i}$ is a lin comb of the other elements of S $\iff$ ==$Span(S) = Span(S \space \backslash \space \vec{v}_{i})$==
		- In words, ==$\vec{v}_{i}$ is a linear combination of the other elements of S if and only if the span of S is the same as the span of S with $\vec{v}_{i}$ removed from the set.==
	- Note: Remember that "$\iff$" is ==bidirectional==. Ie:
		- $Span(S \space \backslash \space \vec{v}_{i}) = Span(S)\iff$ ==$\vec{v}_{i}$ is a lin comb of the other elements of S
			- By eliminating ==unecessary vectors from the spanning set, you can better understand its behavior==
