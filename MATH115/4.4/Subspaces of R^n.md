- Def'n: Given the set U, U is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ if:
	- Requirements:
		- U contains $\vec{0}_{\mathbb{R}^n}$. 
		- For $\vec{x}, \vec{y} \in U$, $\vec{x} + \vec{y} \in U$. (Addition of two vectors in U is closed)
		- For $\vec{x}, c \in \mathbb{R}$, $\vec{x}\in U$. (Vector product in U is closed)
	- Given the above requirements, inear combination of vectors in U is closed in U, as linear combination only has the operators of addition and vector-vector multiplication. 

- Geometric Interpretation:
	- A subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a space that has a certain dimensionality but lives in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
		- Examples:
			- Dimensionality 0: A point living in $\mathbb{R}^n$
			- Dimensionality 1: A line living in $\mathbb{R}^n$
			- Dimensionality 2: A plane living in $\mathbb{R}^n$
			- Dimensionality 3: A hyperplane living in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
		- The list goes on. The key takeaway is that the subspace looks like the space of $\mathbb{R}^{dim(u)}$, however it can take on different spacial positions in $\mathbb{R}^n$
	- The dimensionality of a subspace is determined by the set that it spans. For example, if it spans 2, then it looks like a plane. 

- Note: $\vec{R}^n$ is a subspace of itself.

- Def'n: The trivial subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ U is $U = \{ \vec{0} \}$. 

- Thm: Let $\vec{v_{1}}, \cdots, \vec{v_{k}} \in \mathbb{R}^n$, then $U = \mathrm{Span}(\vec{v_{1}},\cdots,\vec{v_{k}})$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$
	- #TODO Write down the proof for this.

- Thm: Let $U$ be a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then there are vectors $\vec{v_{1}},\cdots,\vec{v_{k}} \in U$ s.t. $\mathrm{Span}(\vec{v_{1}}, \cdots , \vec{v_{k}}) = U$
	- #TODO Write down the proof for this.
