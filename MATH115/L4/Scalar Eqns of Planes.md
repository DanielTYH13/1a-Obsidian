*Key Concepts:*
___

- In R^3, the scalar equations that define a plane have the general form: $ax_{1}+b_{x2}=c$. 
	- This draws a plane as the third unbound variable draws a plane along the line defined by the first two variables
	- You can notice that this is the same definition of a line in R^2

- Scalar equations can be conveniently used to check if a point lies on the plane.
