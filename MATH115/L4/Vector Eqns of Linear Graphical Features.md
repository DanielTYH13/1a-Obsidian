*Key Concepts:*
___

- In $\mathbb{R}^n$, the vector equation of a line is given through point p and with direction $\vec{d}$ by: $\vec{x} = \vec{OP}+t\vec{d}$.
	- $\vec{x}$ is a position vector for a point on the line
		- All $\vec{x}$ along this line can be defined by the lin comb of $\vec{OP}$ and $\vec{d}$.
	- Imagine a position vector from the origin. Now, append scalar multiples of the direction vector onto this vector. 
		- This sketches a line.
	- *To find the line defined by two points*
		- $\vec{OP_{1}}$ and $\vec{OP_{2}}$
		- $\vec{x} = \vec{OP_{1}} + t(\vec{OP_{2}}-\vec{OP_{1}})$

- The general form for a linear graphical feature with dimensions $n$ that lives in $\mathbb{R}^n$
	- $\vec{x} = \vec{OP} + c_{1}\vec{v_{1}}+c_{2}\vec{v_{2}}+\dots+c_{n}\vec{v_{n}}$
		- Where any given $\vec{v_k}$ for $1 \le k \le n$ and $k\in \mathbb{N}$ is in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and no $\vec{v_{k}}$ is collinear.
	- You can derive the general vector form for any given linear feature with dimensions $n$ given that you have $n+1$ unique points that lie on the feature. 
		- For example, with a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$, if you have 3 points, then you can use one for the position vector, and find the difference between that point and the other two to find the direction vectors. 

- $k$ given vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that are not-collinear, are not the zero vectors, and with $k \le n$, will span a linear feature with $k$ dimensions. 
	- This means that they span that line, plane, hyperplane, etc. 

- For any given line, plane, etc $\in \mathbb{R}^n$. There are infinitely many vector eqns
	- Pick any arbitrary point
	- Pick any n arbitrary vectors 

- Vector and parametric eqns are very easy for choosing an arbitrary point from a linear graphical feature
