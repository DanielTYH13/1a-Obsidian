*Key Concepts:*
___

- For the square matrix $A\in M_{nxn}(\mathbb{R})$, if there exists ==a matrix $B\in M_{nxn}(\mathbb{R}) \ni AB = I = BA$==, then $B = A^{-1}$ . 
	- Matrices A and B ==must be square matrices as by definition, their product must be the identity matrix - which is a square matrix==.

Thm: let $A, B \in M_{nxn}(\mathbb{R}) \ni AB = I$==$\implies BA = I \land AB = BA \land \mathrm{Rank}(A) = \mathrm{Rank}(B) = n$:==
- By setting any Matrix Equation of Linear Systems to 0, you can show the # of sol'ns:
	- $B\vec{x} = \vec{0}$
	- If, in RREF form, there are any parameters, there will be infinite sol'ns $\vec{x}$ to this system.
	- #TODO finish this proof.
