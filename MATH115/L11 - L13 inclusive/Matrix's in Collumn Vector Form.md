*Key Concepts:*
___

It is often convenient to represent matrices are a row vector of column vectors.
- This is especially helpful when we are doing [[Matrix-Vector Multiplication]]. 

- The matrix $A \in M_{mxn}(\mathbb{R})$ can be represented as the row vector ==$\begin{bmatrix} \vec{a}_{1} & \vec{a}_{2} & \cdots & \vec{a}_{n} \end{bmatrix}$, given that each entry is the collumn vector $a_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^m$== (Exer - Write a general form for the matrix A in Collumn Vector form.)
