- Def'n: The transpose of a matrix $A \in M_{mxn}(\mathbb{R})$ is the matrix $A^T \in M_{nxm}(\mathbb{R})$, of which's ==collumns are A's rows, and rows are A's collumns.==
	- In formal definition, it is the matrix that fulfills ==$(A^T)_{ij} = A_{ji}$==
		- Note that the ==positions of i and j in each entry have been swapped.==
			- Remember that i is the row index, and j is the collumn index.
