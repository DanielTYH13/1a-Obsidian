Def'n: The identity matrix is defined: ==For all $i = 1, \ldots, n$, $I_{n}\in M_{nxn}(\mathbb{R})$, $i_{ii} = 1$b==
- This looks like a matrix with the ==top left to bottom right diagonal having all entries 1, and the rest of the matrix having entries 0==
	- This is defined in this way for no natural reason, simply because it is the most fitting definition of the identity matrix for the rest of the definitions, such as 
		- Matrix-vector mult.
- Note: Similar to the zero-vector, if ==the dimensionality (n) is clear, then the identity matrix if often just represented as $I$.==
