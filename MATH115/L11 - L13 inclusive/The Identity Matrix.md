*Key Concepts:*
___

Def'n: The identity matrix is defined: ==For all $i = 1, \ldots, n$, $I_{n}\in M_{nxn}(\mathbb{R})$, $i_{ii} = 1$==
- This looks like a matrix with the ==top left to bottom right diagonal having all entries 1, and the rest of the matrix having entries 0==
	- The identity matrix is called the identity matrix because ==$I\vec{x} = \vec{x}$== for all vectors $\vec{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n, I_n$
		- In other words, the identity matrix times itself ==is itself==
		- Matrix-vector mult.
- The identity matrix must ==be a square matrix== 
	- This is because if $I \in M_{mxn}(\mathbb{R})$, where $m \ne n$, then the dimensionality of the resultant vector will be ==of $\vec{R}^m$, which isn't the same.==
- Note: Similar to the zero-vector, if ==the dimensionality () is clear, then the identity matrix if often just represented as $I$.==
