*Key Concepts:*
___
- Def'n: An m x n matrix A is a rectangular distribution of m rows and n columns, where each entry is denoted as $A_{ij}$, or $a_{ij}$, which is the entry of the $i'th$ row and the $j'th$ column: Exercise: Draw out the generalized form of a matrix ==You did it! Maybe==
	- $\begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1j} & \cdots & a{1n} \\ a_{2 1} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2j} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots & & \vdots \\ a_{i1} & a_{i2} & \cdots & a_{ij} & \cdots & a_{in} \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mj} & \cdots & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix}$
- We call the space of matrices in m x n dimensions and with real components ==$M_{m\cdot n}(\mathbb{R})$
	- We call the entry with i and j, the =="(i-j)'th entry"
	- If m = n, then the matrix is a ==square matrix== <!--SR:!2000-01-01,1,250!2025-10-24,3,250-->

- Collumn vectors vs Row vectors:
	- Collumn vectors are strictly ==matrices with n = 1.==
	- Row vectors are strictly ==matrices with m = 1==
	- Note that the definition of matrices is required as ==If it was to be defined by a vector, the vector can be represented in a horizontal and vertical form and technically be equivalent==
		- The matric definition ==removes any ambiguity when perfoming calculations with row and column vectors==

- The zero matrix
	- The zero matrix is simply a matrix with all entries 0.
		- It is denoted by ==$\vec{0}_{m\cdot n}$==
		- In cases where the dimensionality is clear, sometimes it is just denoted ==$\vec{0}$== <!--SR:!2000-01-01,1,250!2025-10-24,3,250-->
