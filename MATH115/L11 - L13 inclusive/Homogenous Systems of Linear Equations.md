Def'n:
- Note: A homogenous system does not mean a constant of 0 IN REF. It means a constant of 0 before carrying to REF. If it was REF, the only sol'n would be the trivial solution if rank(A) = # of equations   
- The trivial solution to a linear equation or system of linear equations in n variables is ==$\vec{0}\in \mathbb{R}^n$
	- In other words, $x_{1}, x_{2},\ldots, x_{n} = 0$ satisfies the equation $\vec{x} = c_1x_{1} + c_{2}x_{2} + \dots + c_{n}x_{n} = k$, where k is some constant value.
	- Corollary: The only systems with the trivial solution are ones that ==have the constant vector term = $\vec{0}$==. <!--SR:!2025-10-24,3,250-->

Def'n
- A homogenous linear equation is one such that the constant term is 0. 
	- A homogenous linear equation always ==has the trivial solution==

- Note: A homogenous linear equation does not ==necessarily only have the trivial solution.==
	- We know that the trivial solution is a solution ==even when it isn't in REF==
		- This is why it is called the trivial solution.
	- However, we can carry to REF to find others.

Note: You can never have no solution in a homogenous system:
- This is because even if you have a 0 row, it will never correlate to a non-zero constant.
