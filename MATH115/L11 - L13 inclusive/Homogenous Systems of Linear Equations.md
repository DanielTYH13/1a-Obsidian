Def'n:
- The trivial solution to a linear equation or system of linear equations in n variables is ==$\vec{0}\in \mathbb{R}^n$
	- In other words, $x_{1}, x_{2},\ldots, x_{n} = 0$ satisfies the equation $\vec{x} = c_1x_{1} + c_{2}x_{2} + \dots + c_{n}x_{n} = k$, where k is some constant value.
	- Corollary: The only systems with the trivial solution are ones that ==have constant term = 0==.

Def'n
- A homogenous linear equation is one such that the constant term is 0. 
	- A homogenous linear equation always ==has the trivial solution==

- Note: A homogenous linear equation does not ==necessarily only have the trivial solution.==
