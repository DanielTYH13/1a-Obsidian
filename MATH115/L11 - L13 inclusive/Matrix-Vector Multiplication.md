*Key Concepts:*
___

- Def'n: Given the matrix $A = \begin{bmatrix} \vec{a}_{1} & \vec{a}_{2} & \cdots & \vec{a}_{n}\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{x} \in {\mathbb{R}}^n$, the matrix-vector product $A\vec{x} = x_{1}\vec{a}_{1} + \cdots + x_{n}\vec{a}_{n}$.
	- Ie, given a matrix A, the product of the matrix is the ==linear combination where the component vectors are the collumn vectors of A and the coefficients are the scalar components of vector X==
- Note -> in order for a vector matrix product to be defined, the vector MUST ==live in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where n is the number of collumns in the matrix.==
	- For example, if you try to multiply a vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and a matrix in $M_{mx2}$, then it is undefined as there is no corresponding collumn vector from the matrix for component 3 of the vector. 

- TBD - understand why matrix vector mult is defined in this way.
