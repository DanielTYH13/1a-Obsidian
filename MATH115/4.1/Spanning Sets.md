*Key Concepts:*
___

- The spanning set of a collection of vectors is the set of vectors that can be represented as a lin. comb. of the collection of vectors for constants $c_{n}\in \mathbb{R}$.
	- $S = {v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{n}}$
	- $Span(S) = \{c_{1}\vec{v_{1}} + c_{2}\vec{v_{2}} + \cdots + c_{n}\vec{v_{n}} | c_{1}, c_{2}, \ldots , c_{n} \in \mathbb{R} \}$

Terminology:
- Let $u = Span(S)$. We say that:
	- u is spanned by s
	- s spans u
	- S is a spanning set for u
		- "a", not "the", because there can be multiple spanning sets for the same set.
		- For example, infinitely many sets can span $\mathbb{R}^n$.
