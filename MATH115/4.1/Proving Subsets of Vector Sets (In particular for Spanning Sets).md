*Key Concepts:*
___

- To prove that a set A is a subset of a set B, and vice versa:
	- Write the ==general form for any arbitrary vector in set A.==
	- Show that ==the general form can always be represented in terms of set B.==

- **Exer. Prove then compare**==:==
	- Example: Given $S = \{\vec{v}_{1}, \vec{v}_{2}, \ldots, \vec{v}_{n}\}$ Show that $S \subseteq Span(S)$
		- For any $k$ from $[1, n]$, $\vec{v_k}$ = $0\vec{v}_{1}+0\vec{v}_{2}\cdots+1\vec{v}_{k}+\cdots+0\vec{v}_{n-1} + 0\vec{v}_n$
		- Thus, since every element of S must be within Span(S), S is a subset or equal to Span(S).
