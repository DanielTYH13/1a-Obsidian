*Key Concepts:*
___
- The Normalization of a vector is given by:
	- $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$
	- $\vec{x}_{normalization} = \frac{\vec{x}}{\| \vec{x} \|}$
	- Geometrically, this can be described as dividing the length of the vector by an amount such that it is 1, and points in the same direction.
	- Algebraically, this can be described as multiplying all the components by a single scalar such that the norm remains 1, but the ratio between all components remains the same. 
- The normalization of a vector means that it is a new vector with the same direction as the original vector, but with a norm of 1. In other words, it has been normalized to a unit vector. 
	- Due to this, all normalized vectors, if placed on the origin, trace the outline of a unit circle.
