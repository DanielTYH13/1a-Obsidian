*Key Concepts:*
___
- Def: Two vectors are parallel if and only if they are scalar multiples of each other
	- This is true because direction is encoded as the ratio between the components of the vector. One vector can be obtained by a scalar multiplication of the other vector, that means that the ratios between the two vectors are the same.
		- $\frac{ab}{ac} = \frac{b}{c}$
