- The norm of the sum of two vectors is less than or equal to the sum of the norm of the two vectors:
	- $\| \vec{x} + \vec{y} \| \le \| \vec{x} \| + \| \vec{y} \|$ 
	- Geometrically, think of a scalene triangle. The hypotenuse will always have a total magnitude less than or at most equal to the sum of the magnitudes of the legs.
