*Key Concepts:*
___
- A unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude of 1. This is useful when you want to describe a direction, but with arbitrary direction. This is often done through multiplication
	- Defined as:
		- $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ 
		- $\vec{x} \text{ is a unit vector} \iff \| \vec{x} \| = 1$ 

- To find the unit vector of the direction of any given vector $\vec{x}$:
	- $\vec{x_{u}} = \frac{\vec{x}}{{\| \vec{x} \|}}$
	- Geometrically: This is equivalent to dividing out the magnitude from the vector, only leaving the direction remaining. In pseudomath: $\vec{x}_{u} = \frac{\vec{x}_{direction}\cdot\vec{x}_{mag}}{\vec{x}_{mag}} = \vec{x}_{direction}$
	- Algebraically: This is equivalent to dividing all the components by a value such that the ratios between them stay the same, and thus the direction, but the length of the vector is equal to one - that is, the root of the sum of the squares of the components is one.
