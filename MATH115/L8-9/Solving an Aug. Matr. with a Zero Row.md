*Key Concepts:*
___
When there is a zero row in an Aug. Matr. in REF form where the number of rows = number of variables, this means that ==one of the variables is unrestricted==
- In other words, no matter what value you assign to this variable, it will still satisfy the terms of the system. 
- When this happens:
	1. Assign the unrestricted variable to ==a parameter==, eg ==t==
	2. Represent all other variables in terms of ==the constant and the parameter for that unrestricted variable==
	3. Rewrite in vector form
	4. If there are more unrestricted variables, repeat the same process for the above.
