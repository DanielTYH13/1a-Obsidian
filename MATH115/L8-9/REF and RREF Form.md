*Key Concepts:*
___
Defn': REF - Row Echelon Form:
1. ==All zero rows are below non-zero rows==
2. ==Each leading entry is to the right to the leading entry above it==
	- This implies that ==all entries under the leading entries are 0's==

Defn': RREF - Reduced Row Echelon Form:
1. ==All of the conditions of REF form==
2. ==Each leading entry is a 1==
	1. This is called a ==Leading entry== 
3. ==Each Leading One is the only non-zero entry in its collumn==
	- This is significant as ==This means that there are no two ways to express  the 
Note:
- RREF implies ==REF==, however REF ==does not imply RREF==.
- While an Aug. Matr. in RREF can have a zero row, it cannot have a ==$\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0&|&c\end{bmatrix}$, where c is a non-zero value.
