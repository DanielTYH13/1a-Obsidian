*Key Concepts:*
___

Def'n: ==Something something that pushes or pulls on an object==

Fundamental forces:
- Strong Nuclear Force: ==The force that keeps Nuclei together==
- Weak Nuclear Force: IDK Yet
- Electromagnetic Force: ==Repulsion between differently charged particles==
- Gravitational Force (By classic mechanics terms): 
	- Note: ==The gravitational force is the most prevelant because it only grows in magnitude, and doesn't decrease==

Define the strong nuclear force as scale 1:

SN: Scale: ==1== Range: ==10^-15 m==
WN: Scale: ==10^-6== Range: ==10^-18m==
Electromagnetic: Scale: ==1/137== Range: infinity

All of the forces that we talk about are ==Abstractions of the Fundamental Forces==
- These are:
	- ==Applied Forces==
	- ==Tension Force==
	- ==The normal Force==
	- ==Friction==
