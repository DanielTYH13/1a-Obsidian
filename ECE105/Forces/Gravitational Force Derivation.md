*Key Concepts:*
___
- The gravitational force is a fundemental force. Therefore, it can be represented using the particle force law, which is:
	- ==$\vec{F} = -G\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^2}\vec{k}$==
		- Where the vector k is the normal unit vector to the earth. 
			- ==$\vec{k} = \frac{\vec{k}}{\|\vec{k}\|}$==

- ==Particle concentration in a dot theorem==
	- If two particles are not intersecting, we can simplify the mass of the particle as a point which lies on the average of the particle's mass
- The gravitational constant g:
	- We can validly assume that ==we will always be approximately as closs to the earth as the radius==
		- Then: $\vec{F} = \left(\frac{Gm_{e}}{R_{e}^2}\right)m_{2}$
			- All of the values in the term before m_2 are constants. We refer to the value of this constant as ==$\vec{g}$==, which is approximately 9.8 m/s^2
			- This is done by using newton's second law:
				- $m\vec{a} = -gm$
				- $\vec{a} = -g$
				- Regardless of the mass of the object, its acceleration due to gravity will always be g in the ==direction of earth==
				- Note, that we cancel out the masses on both sides of the equation 
					- However, LHS mass is inertial mass, RHS is gravitational mass
					- We are allowed to do this due to ==General Relativit's Principle of Equivalence==
