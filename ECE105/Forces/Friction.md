*Key Concepts:*
___
Friction -> ==A force caused by irregularities in m1 and m2 which mesh, causing resistance==
- Common misconception -> ==The coefficient of friction can be greater than 1==
- $\vec{F}_{f}$ is directly opposing ==the motion or the direction of motion:== However, the direction of motion is independent of the normal force.
	- However, it is calculated using ==the normal force==
	- Therefore, we always denote the friction as ==$\|\vec{F}\| = \mu \|\vec{F}_{n}\|$
		- Conversely, it is incorrect to write friction as ==$\vec{F}_f = \mu \vec{F}_n$==

Static Friction -> ==The force of friction when the m1 has no relative motion to m2==
- When the two objects are static, they have time to ==settle, and thus the irregularities have time to form stronger bonds==, resulting in a higher coef than kinetic friction
	- This is generally true ==It is not always true.==
	- This is a balancing force, similar to the normal force
	- It acts as a balancing force ==until a certain threshold, where the mesh breaks==
		- This threshold is defined as $\mu_{s} \vec{f_n}$, where $\mu_{s}$ is the coefficient of static friction. 

Kinetic Friction -> ==The force of friction when m1 has relative motion to m2==
- When two objects are kinetic relative to each other, they do not have ==time to settle, meaning the bonds are not as strong.==
	- This is generally true ==It is not always true.==
- The force of kinetic friction is of ==constant magnitude==.  
	- You can imagine this as the resistance at a ==maximum, where no further resistance will cause a change==
