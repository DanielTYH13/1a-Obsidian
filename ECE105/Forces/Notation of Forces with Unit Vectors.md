*Key Concepts:*
___

Instead of representing vectors outside of 1 dimension with angles, unit vectors can be used. 
- This is especially useful when working with ==hyperdimensional movement==

Unit Vector Representations:
- Force: $\vec{F} = F_{x}\vec{i} + F_y\vec{j}$
- Acceleration: $\vec{a} = a_{x}\vec{i}+ a_{y}\vec{j}$

Once represented this way, you can ==break down 2D problems into individual 1D problems==
