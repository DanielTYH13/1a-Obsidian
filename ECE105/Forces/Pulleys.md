*Key Concepts:*
___
- Pulleys can be used to ==reverse the direction of tension:==

- Ideal pulley -> ==Rope slides over the pulley, the pulley has no mass, and it doesn't move==

- Pulleys can be conceptualized as gear ratios:
	- If the length of the ==movement of the mass is shortened relative to the length of the "Pulling movement", then there is a mechanical advantage==
		- 1 pulley -> Equal force required to movement
		- 2 pulleys -> Length is divided by two, thus 50% of the weight must be pulled
		- If the weight of the mass is n, how much would the apparent weight of the mass if you had m pulleys? ==$\frac{n}{m}$
		-
