*Key Concepts:*
___

Def'n: ==Tension is force exerted on an object that is purely a pull force. It is dissallowed for there to be a net force in the direction of the tension force, which woul compress the tension==
- This is typically conceptualized as a force being transmitted ==Through a rope or a cord, which cannot be compresssed==

A special thing about Tension is that:
- There is no ==unique direction== that the tension points.
	- This is due to ==N3L==, which necessitates that there are forces on each end of the tension force opposing each ==Mass that is connected on it==
		- ==If there is a force on one side of the tension, there must be an equal and opposite force on the other side==
			- Silly thing -> This is why ==A rope being pulled with force F on each side will only have a tension force of F==

Solving total force with tension:
- When solving the total force (And thus the acceleration) Of a system with multiple masses connected by tension:
	- $F_{ext}+T -T = m_{1}\vec{a}+m_{2}\vec{a}$
		- Remember, $F_{ext} = F_{m1}+F_{m2}$
	- $F_{ext} = \vec{a}(m_{1}+m_{2})$
		- This is intuitively correct as because of the fact that ==A tension force needs two forces and has opposite and equal magnitude of forces,== they must fulfill ==N3L==, thus they are similar to [[Contact Forces]], and can thus be cancelled out.
