*Key Concepts:*
___

Utilizing Coordinate Systems for Easier Solving:
- On occasion, it makes it easier to conceptualize a problem or to solve it when you shift the coordinate system. 
	- This is because if you do so, you can oftentimes eliminate unecessary variables, such as removing acceleration in one of the coordinate axises
- For example, shifting the coordinate system of a mass on a plane will let you set the net force on the y axis to be 0.w
