*Key Concepts:*
___

- Solving a system of forces boils down these key objectives:
	- Find all equations of forces present in a system, in a way such that ==you can have enough equations to find the unkowns you are looking for==
	- All the forces working externally on an object can be summarized as ==The total net force==
	- Use the following two conditions to evaluate:
		- $\vec{a} = 0$, then $\Sigma \vec{F_{net}} = 0$
		- $\vec{a} \ne 0$ then $\sigma \vec{F_{net}} = m\vec{a}$
