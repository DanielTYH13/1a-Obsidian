*Key Concepts:*
___
- A contact force is simply a force that is ==transmitted through multiple objects==
	- For example, one block pushes on another, which pushes on another, etc. 

- When solving for contact forces, it is often useful to ==use N3l, as a force applied onto an object is applied back to it in equal and opposite magnitude==

- Solving Contact Forces (In the context of the image above.):
	- In order to solve, add all of the forces in the system together.
		- This is valid, as the net forces can be non-zero
			- However, due to ==N3l, all of the internal forces will cancel each other out==
				- This will apply to ==every system of forces, as long as they are internal.== 
				- This is because the internal forces ==Necessitate that there are reactionary forces==
	- $F - F_{12}+F_{21}-F_{23}+F_{32} = m_{1}a+m_{2}a +m_{3}a$ 
	- $F = m_{1}a+m_{2}a +m_{3}a$
	- $F = \vec{a}(m_{1}+m_{2} +m_{3})$
		- Force in this context is the sum of all forces applied onto the above system of blocks that ==are not internal forces==
