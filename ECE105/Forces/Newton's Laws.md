*Key Concepts:*
___

Law 1 - Inertia:
- Inertia is the following assertion ==An object at rest or in constant motion will remain to be so unless acted upon by an *external* force==
	- This also implies that ==objects in motion can be interpreted to be objects at rest, and vice versa==. 
		- Reference frames such that the ==objects contained within them are called inertial reference frames==, and all of objects within them can be treated as at rest, regardless of whether they are ==moving in relation to other objects==
		- In fact, if this wasn't true, we would have to measure ==all movement on earth relative to the movement of the earth relative to the sun, the sun relative to the galaxy, etc.==
	
Law 2 - Force = ma:
- Newtons second law is simply that a force is defined by the mass of the object times its acceleration.
	- This is denoted as $\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$


Law 3 - Equality of Force
- If one mass exerts a force on another mass, then the other mass exerts a force equal in magnitude but opposite in direction on the first mass:
	- $\vec{F}_{a\to b} = -\vec{F}_{b\to a}$
- N3L in the normal force:
	- The normal force is what is called a ==balancing force==
		- It is the force that opposes a force trying to push a mass through a surface:
	- Take the situation of a mass sitting on a table:
		- Gravity exerts a force on the mass
		- The table exerts a force back on the mass that is equal in magnitude and direction.
		- As the table is held in place, these forces balance out and the mass stays the same.
