*Key Concepts:*
___
According to Hooke's Law:
- The force exerted by a spring is the negative product of the displacement of the spring times the spring coefficient:
	- ==$F = -k\vec{x}$==

The spring force is a restorative force.
- This means that the ==spring will try to move itself back to its point of equilibrium==a

Nearly all materials obey the spring force equation at $\vec{x}$ near ==the point of equilibrium==
- After this, elastic deformation begins to take place
