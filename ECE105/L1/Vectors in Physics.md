*Key Concepts:*
___
- Vectors are often depicted geometrically in physics, as they are used to correspond to real world condition in $\mathbb{R}^n, n <= 3, n\in \mathbb{N}$
- One VERY key point in physics is that vectors are independant of coordinates
	- This means that you can define a coordinate system wherever you'd like, and you don't have to define the absolute position in space that the vector lives at. 

- Component notation of vectors
	- Uses the $\vec{i}, \vec{j}, \vec{k}$ unit vectors, which point in the direction of the axises of the coordinate system.
	- The general form of a vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is given by $\vec{x} = c_{1}\vec{i} + c_{2}\vec{j} + c_{3}\vec{k}$, where the number of terms is the dimension that it is in.
		- *In some cases, the constants c_1 .. c_3 will be functions of time, where the vector changes depending on time*
	- When differentiating a vector with coefficients that are functions of time, just differentiate using the additive and constant multiple rule:
		- $$
		\begin{align}
\vec{pos}(t) & = x(t)\vec{i} + y(t)\vec{j} \\ 
\frac{d}{dt} \vec{pos}(t) & = \frac{d}{dt}x(t)\vec{i} + \frac{d}{dt}y(t)\vec{j}

\end{align}
$$
- Deriving the kinematic equations under uniform motion using integration:
	- $\vec{a}$ is constant
	- $\vec{v(t)} = \vec{a}t + c$, where c is the initial velocity
	- $\vec{x(t)} = \frac{1}{2}\vec{a}t^2 + c_1t + c_2$, where c_1 is the initial velocity and c_2 is the initial position
	- $$
